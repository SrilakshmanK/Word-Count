# Repeated Words Finder

This project is a simple web-based program that detects repeated words in a given text string. The program processes the text to find words that appear more than once, regardless of case, and displays the word count for each repeated word.

## Features

- **Text Processing**: Converts the input text into lowercase and splits it into individual words.
- **Word Counting**: Tracks the number of occurrences of each word.
- **Repeated Words**: Identifies and returns words that occur more than once.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Treats words as the same even if they have different capital
